# equivalence_tests_with_model_averaging
This repository contains the R code used for the paper "Overcoming model uncertainty - how equivalence tests can benefit from model averaging". 
The file "Testing_functions.R" includes internal functions. The simulation study is conducted using the files "Simulation without model uncertainty.R", "Simulation under model uncertainty 1.R", "Simulation under model uncertainty 2.R" and "Simulation under model uncertainty 3.R". The code for the case study ist stored in "Case study.R".
